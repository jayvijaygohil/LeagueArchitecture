# üõ°Ô∏è Android Architecture: Claims and Document Management App

This document outlines the high-level architecture and implementation plan for an Android application focused on managing claims and documents, designed around a modern, layered approach using **Jetpack Compose** and **MVI (Model-View-Intent)** principles.

---

## üèóÔ∏è High-Level Plan

The application is structured into a standard Android architectural pattern, consisting of three main layers: Data, Domain, and Presentation. Background work will be managed via **WorkManager** to handle synchronization tasks.

---

## üíæ Data Layer

The Data Layer is responsible for abstracting data sources and handling data persistence and remote access.

| Component | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Local Data Source** | [cite_start]Uses **Room Database** to store locally and manage data for claims and documents that are pending synchronization with the backend. [cite: 4] |
| **Remote Data Source** | [cite_start]An **API Client** responsible for all interactions with the backend API. [cite: 5] |
| **Repository** | Abstracts data access logic. [cite_start]It decides whether to fetch data from the local or remote source and handles the synchronization logic. [cite: 7] |
| **Background Work** | [cite_start]Utilizes **WorkManager** for reliably uploading pending claims and documents in the background. [cite: 6] |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Domain Layer

The Domain Layer contains the core business logic of the application, independent of any specific UI or data source implementation.

| Component | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Use Cases/Interactors** | [cite_start]Define the specific business operations, such as: `Upload Claim/Document`, `Get Claims`, `Get Documents`, `Edit Claim/Document`, etc. [cite: 9] |
| **Entities** | [cite_start]Defines the core data structures used throughout the application, specifically the **Claim** and **Document** entities. [cite: 10] |

---

## üé® Presentation Layer (MVI)

The Presentation Layer is responsible for handling UI logic, state management, and user interaction, following the **Model-View-Intent (MVI)** architectural pattern.

| Component | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Presenters** | [cite_start]Implemented using **Compose functions**, these handle the UI logic and manage the state of the associated UI screen. [cite: 12] |
| **MVI Intents/Actions** | [cite_start]User actions (e.g., button clicks, text input) that trigger state changes within the application. [cite: 14] |
| **MVI States** | [cite_start]Represents the distinct states of the UI for a given view (e.g., `Loading`, `Success`, `Error`, `Data Ready`). [cite: 13, 15] |

---

## üì± UI Layer (Jetpack Compose)

The UI Layer is built entirely with **Jetpack Compose** for a modern, declarative, and state-driven user interface.

| Screen Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Composable Functions** | [cite_start]Defines the screens for **Lists**, **Details**, and **Add** functionality for both Claims and Documents. [cite: 17] |
| **Wiring** | [cite_start]Connects the **Presenters** with the respective **UI Screens** to manage the flow of data and state. [cite: 18] |

---

## ‚úÖ Initial Implementation Assumptions

* [cite_start]A pre-existing **Backend API** is available for claims and documents management. [cite: 20]
* [cite_start]The initial scope allows for **single image upload** per Claim or Document. [cite: 21]
* [cite_start]**Image selection** will be implemented using the device's default gallery/image picker. [cite: 23]
* [cite_start]The diagram for error handling and network checks will be simplified, but the implementation is expected to use a robust **`LeagueException`**-based system. [cite: 22]

---

## üöÄ Future Improvements and Enhancements

These items are planned for subsequent iterations:

### Core Functionality
* [cite_start]**Upload Progress Indicators:** Displaying upload status on Home and List screens. [cite: 25]
* [cite_start]**Upload Cancellation:** Ability to stop an in-progress background upload. [cite: 26]
* [cite_start]**Claim/Document Deletion:** Implementing logic for removing saved items. [cite: 27]
* [cite_start]**Document Download:** Adding functionality to download documents from the backend. [cite: 32]

### Media & File Management
* [cite_start]**Multiple Images:** Support for uploading more than one image per Claim/Document. [cite: 29]
* [cite_start]**File Type Support:** Extending support to various file types beyond images. [cite: 30]
* [cite_start]**In-App Capture:** Integration of **CameraX** or a third-party document scanning SDK for in-app image capture. [cite: 31]

### User Experience & Intelligence
* [cite_start]**Search and Filtering:** Implementing robust search and filtering capabilities based on criteria like **name, date, status, amount, and type**. [cite: 28]
* [cite_start]**Intelligent Auto-fill:** Utilizing **Google ML Kit** for text recognition (OCR) to automatically extract metadata and populate form fields. [cite: 33]
